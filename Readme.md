# How to set-up

This section tells you how to setup a self-hosted instance of Autolycus

## Pre-requisites

You will be going to need the Docker Command line tools before installation. They include:
    1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
    1. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) command

Install these before proceeding.

## Setup

**Note**: You will need to be a sudoer or higher in the host you want to setup the instance in.

Follow these steps to setup the instance:

1. Create `.env` file inside the project root folder, add the following to it (refer `example.env`)

```env
POSTGRES_DB=autolycus              # Postgresql database name
POSTGRES_USER=admin                # Postgresql username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin            # Postgresql password
API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api  # Endpoint at which the api will be serving
```

1. Run the following command (preferably in a tmux session or similiar to keep the server running after disconnecting)

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

This command will 
    - Pull appropriate NodeJS, üêç Python and PostgreSQL docker image from the marketplace
    - Install dependencies for Python (pip) and NodeJS (npm) on the first-time boot
    - Setup libtorrent for linux (for downloading torrents)

After succesfull completions, the react frontend (user entry point) would be open at port 3000 in **development** mode and api would be open at port 5000 (by default).

# Known Issues

1. Unable to download complete folders at a time
    - After the magnet-link torrent get downloaded on the server, the user would be unable to download the complete folder at once. This is because the `Folder-archiving` feature is still being implemented. (#30)
    - However, users could downlaod folders' files individually for now.
1. Email verification not implemented
    - Currently, users could signup using any email, since email-verification has not been implemented.
    - This would lead to a lost account in case the user forgets his/her password.
1. Password reset mechanism absent
    - Users would be unable to restore access to their account in case they forget their password.
    - Forget password page is still under development.
